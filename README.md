# Wordpress Blog Theme
I built a theme for my blog site using Wordpress, Genesis Theme (theme framework), PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML, DigitalOcean, Linux (Ubuntu), and more.

Launching my blog was a good experience, but I am much more into developing than blogging (but I like to write, so blogging is still something I may come back to soon).

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to design, build, and launch a wordpress blog.

## Live
I hosted my blog on Digital Ocean at novak.codes, but I have since shutdown the site because I wanted to make novak.codes into something different.

## Achievements
What I achieved from this project was that I got to learn a lot of tools that I hadn't used before or wasn't too familiar with (i.e. Wordpress and Digital Ocean), as well as launch a full featured Wordpress blog onto the web! I also learned how to create Wordpress themes, plugins, and widgets.

## Features
Project features include:
- Responsive web design
- CSS Transitions and Animations
- My custom Wordpress widgets/plugins
- My custom Wordpress theme
