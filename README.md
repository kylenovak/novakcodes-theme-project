# Wordpress Blog Theme
I built a web app using Wordpress, Genesis Theem (theme framework), PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML, DigitalOcean, Linux (Ubuntu), and more. The purpose of this project was to design, build, and launch a wordpress blog.

I hosted my blog on Digital Ocean at novak.codes, but i have since shutdown the site because I wanted to make novak.codes into something different.

Launching my blog was a good experience, but I am much more into developing than blogging (but I like to write, so blogging is still something I may come back to soon).

## Achivements
What I achieved from this project was that I got to learn a lot of tools that I hadn't used before, as well as launch a full featured app onto the web!

## Features
Project features include:
- Admin console with login/logout capability
- CMS (Content Management System)
- My custom Wordpress widgets/plugins
- My custom Wordpress theme
