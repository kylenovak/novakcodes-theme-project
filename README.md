# Wordpress Blog Theme
I built a theme for my blog site using Wordpress, Genesis Theme (theme framework), PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, HTML, DigitalOcean, Linux (Ubuntu), and more. The purpose of this project was to design, build, and launch a wordpress blog.

I hosted my blog on Digital Ocean at novak.codes, but i have since shutdown the site because I wanted to make novak.codes into something different.

Launching my blog was a good experience, but I am much more into developing than blogging (but I like to write, so blogging is still something I may come back to soon).

## Achievements
What I achieved from this project was that I got to learn a lot of tools that I hadn't used before, as well as launch a full featured Wordpress blog onto the web! I also learned how to create Wordpress themes, plugins, and widgets.

## Features
Project features include:
- My custom Wordpress widgets/plugins
- My custom Wordpress theme
